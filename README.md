# Analyzing Wikipedia Clickstreams with PySpark

## Overview

This project leverages the **Wikipedia Clickstream dataset**, an open-source dataset provided by Wikipedia, which tracks user navigation between linked Wikipedia articles. It provides insight into how users arrive at specific pagesâ€”whether through internal links from other Wikipedia articles or from external sources such as search engines. This project uses **PySpark** to process and analyze the dataset efficiently.

## Dataset Description

The **Wikipedia Clickstream dataset** contains records of user navigation between Wikipedia pages. It captures clickstreams, or sequences of user clicks, from one article to another. Some key attributes of the dataset include:

- **Source**: The originating page of the click, which can either be:
  - Another Wikipedia article  
  - An external source, such as:
    - **external-search**: Clicks from search engines  
    - **external-social**: Clicks from social media platforms  
    - **external-other**: Clicks from other external websites  

- **Target**: The destination page on Wikipedia.

- **Type**: The nature of the clickstream, indicating whether it came from a link on another Wikipedia page or from an external source.

- **Count**: The total number of times a specific click event occurred within the dataset period.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Understand user behavior**: Analyze user navigation patterns between Wikipedia pages.
2. **Identify key entry points**: Explore which pages attract most traffic from external sources.
3. **Discover popular internal links**: Investigate how articles drive traffic to other pages within Wikipedia.
4. **Identify trends and insights**: Extract insights about user preferences and content consumption habits.

## Tools and Technologies

- **PySpark**: Used to process large-scale datasets efficiently.
- **Python**: General programming tasks, including data visualization and summary statistics.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive coding environment for development and analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**  
   - Load the Wikipedia Clickstream dataset into PySpark.  
   - Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze the most frequent entry points (e.g., from search engines).  
   - Identify the top internal navigation patterns (from one article to another).  
   - Explore external sources that bring significant traffic to Wikipedia.

3. **Data Aggregation and Insights**  
   - Group and aggregate the data to identify the most popular pages.  
   - Analyze click distributions across different source types.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Create charts and plots to represent user behavior patterns.  
   - Highlight key entry points and popular Wikipedia articles.

5. **Conclusions and Future Work**  
   - Summarize key findings and trends.  
   - Propose future directions for further analysis or potential applications.
